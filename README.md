Predicting Diabetes
* Goal is to predict if someone has diabetes.
* Goal of model is to maximize recall to minimize the number of people with diabetes that are not diagnosed.
* Data was imported and cleaned.
* Exploratory data analysis performed.
* Feature selection explored to optimize results.
* Created Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network.
* Logistic Regression selected due to largest recall and ROC AUC score.
* Performance of models could be improved by better balancing the dataset.
* SMOTE was used, but could still see imbalance issue with differences between recall and precision.
